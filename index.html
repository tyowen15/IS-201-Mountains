    <h2>Sheer Scale</h2>
    <p id="pinkparagraph">Mountains have a way of capturing our attention long before we set foot on their slopes. Their sheer scale,
        rising boldly against the horizon, reminds us of the vastness of the world and our small but meaningful place
        within it. Whether covered in snow, glowing with sunrise colors, or wrapped in low-hanging clouds, mountains
        stand as timeless symbols of strength and wonder.</p>

    <p>Beyond their visual beauty, mountains inspire a deeper sense of peace and reflection. The air feels clearer, the
        sounds quieter, and the pace of life slower. Each trail, ridge, and valley invites us to step away from noise
        and reconnect with nature in its rawest form. It’s no surprise that people have always looked to mountains for
        inspiration, adventure, and moments of clarity.</p>

        <li class="pretty">Few people are found here</li>

    </ul></div>    



    </p>Yet their beauty isn’t found only in the dramatic views at the summit. It’s in the details—the way light moves
    across a rocky face, the scent of pine forests as you climb, and the hidden lakes and wildlife tucked between
    ridgelines. Mountains aren’t just landscapes; they are experiences. They remind us that the world is full of places
    worth exploring, and that beauty often waits where the trail gets steep.</p>
